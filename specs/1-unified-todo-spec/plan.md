# Implementation Plan: The Evolution of Todo – Unified Implementation Plan (Colorful CLI)

**Branch**: `1-unified-todo-spec` | **Date**: 2026-01-02 | **Spec**: [specs/1-unified-todo-spec/spec.md](specs/1-unified-todo-spec/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/1-unified-todo-spec/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan translates the unified specification for "The Evolution of Todo" into a structured, stepwise implementation plan. The goal is to enable an AI agent (Claude Code) to generate a visually appealing, colorized, and user-friendly CLI Todo application. The implementation will proceed in ordered stages, adhering strictly to the approved specification and constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: `rich` for colorful and formatted console output.
**Storage**: In-memory data structures.
**Testing**: `pytest` for unit and integration testing.
**Target Platform**: Console/Terminal.
**Project Type**: Single project (`/src` directory structure).
**Performance Goals**: The application should be responsive and handle user input without noticeable delay.
**Constraints**: No web UI, external databases, or multi-user support. All code must be generated by Claude Code.
**Scale/Scope**: A single-user, in-memory console application with basic, intermediate, and advanced features as defined in the spec.

## Constitution Check

- [X] **Spec-Driven Development**: A written specification exists for this feature.
- [X] **No Manual Coding**: All code is intended to be generated by the approved agent (Claude Code).
- [X] **Deterministic Behavior**: Interactions and outputs are predictable and testable.
- [X] **Simplicity with Extensibility**: The design is minimal and allows for future evolution.
- [X] **Clean Architecture**: There is a clear separation between data, logic, and interface.

```

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is chosen for its simplicity and clear separation of concerns, which aligns with the "Clean Architecture" principle. The `src` directory will contain the application's source code, organized into `models`, `logic`, and `cli` packages.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations of the constitution that require justification.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Project Foundation
1.  Initialize Python project structure (`/src`, `main.py`, subdirectories).
2.  Establish the core application loop in `main.py`.
3.  Define shared utilities for input validation and console formatting (using `rich`).

### Stage 2: Core Data Model
1.  Define the `Task` data structure in `src/models/task.py`.
2.  Implement the in-memory task collection in `src/logic/task_manager.py`.

### Stage 3: Core Essentials (Basic Level)
1.  Implement "Add Task" functionality.
2.  Implement "View Task List" with colorful output.
3.  Implement "Update Task".
4.  Implement "Delete Task".
5.  Implement "Mark as Complete".

### Stage 4: Organization & Usability Enhancements (Intermediate Level)
1.  Implement priority assignment with color-coding.
2.  Implement tag management.
3.  Implement search and filter functionality.
4.  Implement sorting.

### Stage 5: Intelligent Task Behavior (Advanced Level)
1.  Implement due dates with color-coding for overdue tasks.
2.  Implement time reminders within the application.
3.  Implement recurring tasks.

### Stage 6: CLI UX Refinement (Polish)
1.  Refine the menu structure with `rich`.
2.  Improve visual formatting with tables and symbols.
3.  Standardize feedback and messaging colors.

### Stage 7: Validation & Spec Compliance
1.  Verify all features against the specification.
2.  Confirm separation of concerns.
3.  Validate that all code is generated by Claude Code.
